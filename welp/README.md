A bit complicated but this is an example of custom hook(useBusinessSearch)

* Option 1: *
I made lambda function that hits the Yelp API endpoint. So you do not need an API key anymore. Simply send a request to
<https://yelp-backend.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/search?location=berlin&term=burgers>

The location and the term are the values you pull from the form
